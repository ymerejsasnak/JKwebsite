  	<h4>Being Human: Composition/Sound Design</h4>
	  <p>
		  Under the guidance of the film's director/writers I created the music/sound design and worked on much of the audio post-production.  The film was shown at the 2010 Dam Short Film Festival and the 2010 Seattle True Independent Film Festival.  Watch (and <em>listen</em>!) <a href="http://vimeo.com/14660897" target="_blank">here</a>.
