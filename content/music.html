  	<h4>Psychedelic Ambient Collage Soundtracks (huh?)</h4>
	  <p>
		  From around the same time period as below and using some of the same sounds, though typically in different sonic contexts.  Less noisy and chaotic (usually).  More composed and cohesive feeling.  On Bandcamp <a href="https://jeremykansas.bandcamp.com/album/four-short-films" target="_blank">here</a>.

  	<h4>Being Human: Composition/Sound Design</h4>
	  <p>
		  Under the guidance of the film's director/writers I created the music/sound design and worked on much of the audio post-production.  The film was shown at the 2010 Dam Short Film Festival and the 2010 Seattle True Independent Film Festival.  Watch (and <em>listen</em>!) <a href="http://vimeo.com/14660897" target="_blank">here</a>.
