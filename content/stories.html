  	<h4>To Absent Friends</h4>
	  <p>
		  The first short story I actually got <em>paid</em> for!  While maybe "just" a surreal horror story on the surface, I feel like it has a thematically rich core and actually has a lot to say.  Recommended if you wish Stephen King read more Thomas Ligotti.  Read it in Encounters Magazine <a href="http://www.blackmatrixpub.com/documents/Encounters%2009.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
