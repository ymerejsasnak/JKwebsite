  	<h4>To Absent Friends</h4>
	  <p>
		  The first short story I actually got <em>paid</em> for!  While maybe "just" a surreal horror story on the surface, I feel like it has a lot to say.  Read it in Encounters Magazine <a href="http://www.blackmatrixpub.com/documents/Encounters%2009.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

  	<h4>Anatomy of a Date</h4>
	  <p>
		  A very short story, and one of my earliest attempts at marrying humor and horror.  It was published <em>many</em> years ago at <a href="http://www.horrorfind.com/">Horrorfind</a>.  Read my .pdf of it <a href="../Anatomy of a Date.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
