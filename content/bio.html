  	<h4>BIO (I swear I tried to keep it short)</h4>
	  <p>
		  In the early nineties my family finally got its first computer, an AppleII+ (which even then was pretty outdated if I remember correctly), but I fell in love with it and taught myself to program some simple things in BASIC.  When we eventually got a decent (for the time) PC running Windows 3.1, I taught myself QBasic.  Throughout high school I was certain I would go on to major in computer science.  That didn't happen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	I dropped out of college two seperate times and spent the next 10-15 years working on being a writer of short stories (of which I have published a few) and an experimental electronic music composer/producer (which got me some unpaid soundtrack work and a listing on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3615246/" target="_blank">IMDB</a>). But I paid the bills by working third shift at a gas station for a long time, then got married and had a baby and became manager/bookkeeper at a small group of privately owned gas station/convenience stores.  That was <em>not</em> how I wanted to spend 40+ hours of my week.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	While there were times in those intervening years that I felt the pull of code and went back to mess with various languages such as C/C++ and BlitzBasic, it was not until Februrary of 2014, after reexamining my life and hearing a news piece on NPR about Codecademy that I decided to dive back into the field I perhaps should have never abandoned.  I did not have the time or money to go back to a "real" school, so I took a number of <a href="http://www.saylor.org/" target="_blank">Saylor.org</a> courses, earning certificates in basic computer science, discrete math, and data structures/algorithms (<a href="#certificates">see above</a>).  But it still wasn't what I wanted exactly.  Sure I was picking up some Java and C++, but I wanted to <em>build</em> things, higher-level things I could share with other people, not just learn theory and implement a linked list.  (Not to say that stuff isn't important, I'm happy to have gotten that background).
	  <p>
	  	Finally, I discovered a few websites (such as <a href="http://christopherpound.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer/" target="_blank">this guide</a> and <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>) that laid out a curriculum for learning web development.  I mostly followed Odin at first, learning Ruby with the intention of also eventually learning Rails, and that was great fun.  Ruby brought back my love of coding tenfold.  But I had to think practically, too, especially after being laid off, and in October 2014 I decided to focus on front-end development, specifically doing my best to learn the quirky and sometimes infuriating Javascript (also using <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html" target="_blank">this</a> excellent book) in the hope of being able to land an entry/junior level FE web development job.  (In the future I do intend to go back and learn server-side programming as well, and I'm more likely to look into Node than Ruby/Rails at this point, but only time will tell for sure.) 
    </p>
    <p>
	  	So that's where I am as of this writing.  All of the projects in the portfolio portion of this site have been made in the last few months.  They aren't perfect, but I believe they show that I have learned quite a lot...and I am hungry to learn so much more, because despite the hours and hours of work I have put into my education, it has also been <strong>great fun</strong>.

  	<h4>About this site</h4>
	  <p>
		  This website was hand-coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, using no templates or frameworks or libraries other than jQuery.  I am <em>not</em> a graphic designer, but I did my best (after multiple redesigns that left my CSS looking like a tangled mess) to make a clean site with a minimal but unique look.  There is still much work to be done to ensure its cross-browser compatibility and the fluidity of the display on screens of varying sizes, but if you would like to see the source it can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/ymerejsasnak/JKwebsite" target="_blank">github</a>.
