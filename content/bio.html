  	<h4>My Coding Journey</h4>
	  <p>
		  In the early nineties my family finally got its first computer, an AppleII+ (which even then was pretty outdated if I remember correctly), but I fell in love with it and taught myself to program some simple things in BASIC.  When we eventually got a decent (for the time) PC running Windows 3.1, I taught myself QBasic (without a book, and before the proliferation of coding tutorials online).  Throughout high school I was certain I would go on to major in computer science.  That didn't happen.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	I dropped out of college two seperate times and spent the next 10-15 years working on being a writer of short stories (of which I have published a few) and an experimental electronic music composer/producer (which got me some unpaid soundtrack work and a listing on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3615246/" target="_blank">IMDB</a>). But I paid the bills by working third shift at a gas station for a long time, then got married and had a baby and became manager/bookkeeper at a small group of privately owned gas station/convenience stores.  That was <em>not</em> how I wanted to spend 40+ hours of my week.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	While there were times in those intervening years that I felt the pull of code and went back to mess with various languages such as C/C++ and BlitzBasic, it was not until Februrary of 2014, after reexamining my life and hearing a news piece on NPR about the "Hour of Code" that I decided to dive back into the field I perhaps should have never abandoned.  I did not have the time or money to go back to a "real" school, so I took a number of <a href="http://www.saylor.org/" target="_blank">Saylor.org</a> courses, earning certificates in basic computer science, C++, discrete math, and data structures.  But though learning all that theory and underlying architecture is still important to me, and something I intend to continue when time allows, I was itching to build things.  I am, after all, a creator at heart.
	  <p>
	  	Finally, I discovered a few websites (such as <a href="http://christopherpound.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer/" target="_blank">this guide</a> and <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>) that laid out a curriculum for learning web development.  I mostly followed Odin at first, learning Ruby with the intention of also eventually learning Rails, and that was fun.  Ruby brought back my love of coding tenfold.  But I still had nothing I could, for instance, share with my spouse, so I switched gears a bit and dove into learning front-end development, focusing mostly on Javascript (using <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html" target="_blank">this</a> excellent book) and picking up the necessary HTML and CSS as I went along.  I'm fairly confident in all three now.
    </p>

    <p>
	  	Anyway, that's where I am as of this writing (January 2015).  All of the web projects in the portfolio portion of this site have been made during my self-education.  They aren't perfect, but I believe they show that I have learned quite a lot...and I am hungry to learn so much more, because despite the hours and hours of work I have put in, it has also been <strong>great fun</strong>.
	  </p>

     <p>
      <strong>March 2015 Update:</strong> I've scrapped my plans to learn Ruby, picked up a little PHP and MySQL for simple stuff, and am currently learning Python for lots of reasons, only one of which is server-side coding (probably with Django, but I'm not discounting other less popular frameworks yet).  I'm also thinking of eventually learning server-side JavaScript as well (I have already toyed with node.js, Express, and MongoDB), since the future of the web, at least as it appears today, seems to be owned by JavaScript.
