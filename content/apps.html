    <h4>Word Virus</h4>
    <p>
    	<strong>Ongoing project, far from complete.</strong>  This will be a web-based notepad app with a focus on creative writing functionality.  It has or will have a number of features that are rarely (if ever?) seen in typical notepads.  There will be various generator options to create random pieces of text, randomization options to jumble existing text in various ways, and other special options such as invisible text and disabling of delete/backspace.  While the UI is still ugly/buggy and only a small percentage of the functions have been implemented, I wanted to put this here.  I will update as I progress.  I really believe in this app, and think that the 0.001% of internet users that might ever use something odd like this will really love it, too.  <a href="#">NEED TO ADD LINK!</a>

    	<strong>Plans:</strong> (will type these up soon)

  	<h4>Unrealistic Life Simulator</h4>
	  <p>
		  This began as the Chapter 7 project "Electronic Life" in <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a>.  It's actually older than some of the projects below, but I was holding off on putting it here because I had hoped to improve it more...but sadly I have not been able to make time for it, so here it is, 99% complete.  Anyway, this is by far my favorite project I've made in JavaScript.  The original project from the book just had a simple text-based display.  After completing that, I went ahead and converted the JS DOM code to use jQuery (which I kick myself for now, but it was the only way I knew how to work with the DOM at the time), then I improved the display quite a bit, added functionality to change the speed of the simulation, various options for editing the map, and perhaps most importantly I came up with a number of my own lifeforms to add into the program.  It was with this project, which I worked on for a non-stop six hours one night without even realizing how long I'd spent, that I knew for certain that coding was my calling.  <a href="content/apps/terrarium/terrarium.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.

	  <p>
      <b>Primary issue:</b> I have not gotten around to implementing the save/load functionality yet.

  	<h4>Map Quiz</h4>
	  <p>
		  One of the more recent little web apps I made.  It uses the Google Maps API to load a satellite photo of a city (randomly chosen from the 22 I currently have in the code).  You need to choose the right city name based only on the satellite photo.  It runs through all 22 cities then tells you how many you got right at the end.  <a href="content/apps/mapquiz/map.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> The buttons need to be disabled while showing the right/wrong message, the buttons should be disabled at the end of the game, and the game should give an option to restart instead of just stopping completely at the end.  Also, I would like to add functionality to pull city names and coordinates from an online API instead of storing the info in the code by hand.

  	<h4>Snake Clone</h4>
	  <p>
		  Began as a snake clone, but evolved into something a little different based solely on the images I ended up using.  As usual, movement is automatic and you change direction with the arrow keys.  You eat to grow, but in this game you <em>can</em> cross your own path.  The hazards come in the form of the spikes that are added to the game each time you "level up."  Stars give bonus points (level times length) and your high scores are saved in localStorage.  <a href="content/apps/snake/index.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
      <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> Usual cleanup and improvements. Maybe some tweaks to the gameplay.  And even if the display scales correctly on smaller devices (which I have yet to address), arrow keys are not touchscreen friendly.

  	<h4>Memory</h4>
	  <p>
		  Pretty typical memory matching game where you flip cards to match the letters of the alphabet.  To add a unique element and extra programming challenge, I added two special cards.  The asterisk randomly shuffles the cards if you pick it.  The plus sign auto-matches a pair for you if you pick it.  (Both special cards flip back over if the cards are reshuffled).  <a href="content/apps/memory/memory.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
      <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> The usual cleanups and improvements, but it plays fine for now so that's why it's here.
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section>
  	<h4>Lights Out</h4>
	  <p>
		  Typical click-to-shut-off-all-the-lights type of game.  Though with various game modes to make it a more interesting challenge.  This was my third ever JavaScript project and my first that was self-directed rather than being an assignment/tutorial.  <a href="content/apps/lightsout/lights-out.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
      <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> The code could use some refactoring and the display could be far more responsive and compatible. Also I wanted to improve the UI and visuals in general.

  	<h4>Github (the good, the bad, and the fugly)</h4>
	  <p>
	  	While the above are (or will, I hope, eventually be) some of the more interesting and/or polished examples of my personal educational projects up to now, there are so many more.  The intrepid explorer can view all the source code of all my projects (warts and all) on <a href="https://github.com/ymerejsasnak?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Github</a>.
