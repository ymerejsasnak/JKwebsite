  	<h4>Github</h4>
	  <p>
		  I will add direct links to the games and web apps I make once I feel they are finished enough to share in such a way.  Until then you can view all my source code on <a href="https://github.com/ymerejsasnak?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Github</a>.

  	<h4>Map Quiz</h4>
	  <p>
		  One of the more recent little web apps I made.  It uses the Google Maps API to load a satellite photo of a city (randomly chosen from the 22 I currently have in the code).  You need to choose the right city name based only on the satellite photo.  It runs through all 22 cities then tells you how many you got right at the end.  <a href="content/apps/mapquiz/map.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> The buttons need to be disabled while showing the right/wrong message, the buttons should be disabled at the end of the game, and the game should give an option to restart instead of just stopping completely at the end.  Also, I would like to add functionality to pull city names and coordinates from an online API instead of storing the info in the code by hand.

  	<h4>Snake Clone</h4>
	  <p>
		  Began as a snake clone, but evolved into something a little different based solely on the images I ended up using.  As usual, movement is automatic and you change direction with the arrow keys.  You eat to grow, but in this game you <em>can</em> cross your own path.  The hazards come in the form of the spikes that are added to the game each time you "level up."  Stars give bonus points (level times length) and your high scores are saved in localStorage.  <a href="content/apps/snake/index.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
      <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> Usual cleanup and improvements. Maybe some tweaks to the gameplay.

  	<h4>Memory</h4>
	  <p>
		  Pretty typical memory matching game where you flip cards to match the letters of the alphabet.  To add a unique element and extra programming challenge, I added two special cards.  The asterisk randomly shuffles the cards if you pick it.  The plus sign auto-matches a pair for you if you pick it.  (Both special cards flip back over if the cards are reshuffled).  <a href="content/apps/memory/memory.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
      <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> The usual cleanups and improvements, but it plays fine for now so that's why it's here.

	<section>
  	<h4>Lights Out</h4>
	  <p>
		  Typical click-to-shut-off-all-the-lights type of game.  Though with various game modes to make it a more interesting challenge.  This was my third ever JavaScript project and my first that was self-directed rather than being an assignment/tutorial.  <a href="content/apps/lightsout/lights-out.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
      <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> The code could use some refactoring and the display could be far more responsive and compatible. Also I wanted to improve the UI and visuals in general.
