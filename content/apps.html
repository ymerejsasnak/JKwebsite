  	<h4>Github</h4>
	  <p>
		  I will add direct links to the games and web apps I make once I feel they are finished enough to share in such a way.  Until then you can view all my source code on <a href="https://github.com/ymerejsasnak?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Github</a>.

  	<h4>Map Quiz</h4>
	  <p>
		  One of the more recent little web apps I made.  It uses the Google Maps API to load a satellite photo of a city (randomly chosen from the 22 I currently have in the code).  You need to choose the right city name based only on the satellite photo.  It runs through all 22 cities then tells you how many you got right at the end.  <a href="content/apps/mapquiz/map.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b>Known issues/future plans:</b> The buttons need to be disabled while showing the right/wrong message, the buttons should be disabled at the end of the game, and the game should give an option to restart instead of just stopping completely at the end.  Also, I would like to add functionality to pull city names and coordinates from an online API instead of storing the info in the code by hand.

  	<h4>Lights Out</h4>
	  <p>
		  Typical click-to-shut-off-all-the-lights type of game.  This was my third ever JavaScript project and my first that was self-directed rather than being an assignment/tutorial.  <a href="content/apps/lightsout/lights-out.html" target="_blank">Play it</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
      <b>Known issues and future plans:</b> The code could use some refactoring and the display could be far more responsive and compatible. Also I wanted to improve the UI and visuals in general.
