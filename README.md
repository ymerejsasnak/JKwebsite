 [[idea: have little 'don't click here', if you do it runs my snow2 sliming thing over whole page (canvas overlaid)
    [[another idea: button that goes to alternate style (8bit msdos retro sort of look) but with exact same content (prob just load new html/css files)



[[[thought: 1st section in each content page should be a little intro?  or save all that for the bio?]]]




TO DO: 
!!start filling in content -- then figure out design of content parts (each item/entry/post/whatever is new section within wrapping section)
-add seperate link to good example web pages I've made too? (for portfolio purposes)
-add link to my github on about, maybe other stuff just for fun like goodreads, etc.
