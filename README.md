###content

* apps - work on portfolio and add stuff asap!
* music - embed a sample song or two in page w/ bandcamp widget?
* stories - eventually try to publish other 'finished stories' or just put here if I give up on subbing them
* bio - add resume once it's done, add 'contactme' link (set up email on my new domain???), add link to JS test, Udemy cert when class done
* add 'an honest self-assessment of my skills' - to either portfolio or bio page or maybe blog...kind of like a long winded resume of web knowledge

###other things?
* eventually make it dynamic...add blog (w/ CMS), etc.
* add a bunch of social functionality (share on facebook, google+, etc)?

###issues:
* ??slime doesn't work on phone??? (does it work on tablet?)

####changes on server:
lost track...at this point, just delete everything from server that no longer exists locally, then update ALL files with current local files
in future, automate this! (grunt?)
