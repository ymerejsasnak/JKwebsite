CUT CERTS FROM PAGE!

###content
* main - mostly fine for now
* apps - work on portfolio and add stuff asap!
* music - mostly fine.  embed a sample song or two in page w/ bandcamp widget?
* stories - fine for now. try to publish other 'finished stories' or just put here if I give up on subbing them
* blog - just leave it for now
* bio - mostly fine.  add resume once it's done, add 'contactme' link (set up email on my new domain???)
* add 'an honest self-assessment of my skills' - to either portfolio or bio page or maybe blog...kind of like a long winded resume of web knowledge


###other things?
* add a bunch of social functionality (share on facebook, etc)
* google analytics, seo, etc?


###issues:
* keep working on header responsiveness (use media queries)
* get rid of margins on smaller devices
* slime doesn't work on phone??? (does it work on tablet?)
