 [[idea: have little 'don't click here', if you do it runs my snow2 sliming thing over whole page (canvas overlaid)
    [[another idea: button that goes to alternate style (8bit msdos retro sort of look) but with exact same content (prob just load new html/css files)




[[[[REDESIGN!!!!!!!!]]]]




TO DO: 
make all img as small as possible filesize-wise
start filling in content
-add seperate link to good example web pages I've made too? (for portfolio purposes)
-add link to my github on about, maybe other stuff just for fun like goodreads, etc.



remember:::::!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
