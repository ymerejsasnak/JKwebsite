###to do
* slimer - make sure this is working correctly
* main - mostly fine for now
* apps - work on portfolio and add stuff asap!
* music - put better tracks on bandcamp and add them to page (and maybe embed songs in page instead of link)
* stories - add anatomy (in what format?  make it a pdf?) at least for now
* blog - just leave it for now
* bio - mostly fine, add bandcamp link, add resume once it's done, add 'contactme' link (set up email on my new domain???)
* add 'an honest self-assessment of my skills' - to either portfolio or bio page or maybe blog...kind of like a long winded resume of web knowledge



###issues:
* I broke the slimer!  how to fix it?!?!?
* do certs load yet? --no?  maybe just put pdf <object> to load in seperate html file on seperate page
* keep working on header responsiveness (use media queries)
* rest of site looks ok on tablet, maybe just have media query to get rid of margins, then test on phone too
