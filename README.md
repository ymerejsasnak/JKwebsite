 [[idea: have little 'don't click here', if you do it runs my snow2 sliming thing over whole page (canvas overlaid)
    [[another idea: button that goes to alternate style (8bit msdos retro sort of look) but with exact same content (prob just load new html/css files)





###to do
* slimer - make sure it works, clean up code
* main - mostly fine for now
* apps - work on portfolio and add stuff asap!
* music - put better tracks online and add them to page
* stories - add anatomy (in what format?  make it a pdf?) at least for now
* blog - just leave it for now
