##TODO:
* delete everything from server that no longer exists locally, then update ALL files with current local files
* files: all content files, terrarium files, word virus as it stands now


###future?

* dev - put mastermind up here
* music - embed a sample song or two in page w/ bandcamp widget?
* bio - add resume and 'contactme' link
* was gonna add a blog and cms...but instead will probably just use wordpress and link to it...keep this site static and simple

###issues:
* ??slime doesn't work on phone??? (does it work on tablet?)
