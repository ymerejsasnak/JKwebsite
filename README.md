starting the long slow process of creating my web site<br>

going to use this as an opportunity to practice as much as possible<br>

but especially practice stuff I haven't used much/at all: media queries, transitions, grid layout,


NOTES:  need to chop up paper jpgs and definitely make them SMALLER FILE SIZE!!!! but still good looking


 content:

-games/apps I make...other CS related stuff
-published stories, writing related
-music - link to bandcamp page at least
-writings (this is not a blog!)
    -about all of above, giftedness, philosophy, avoidant personality/depression/anxiety, etc.
     (1st post - technology is not _good_ ---but not nec bad either)

design:

go with mostly grayscale, paper background, typewriter fonts
!part of design is the way I type the text! (see example already in html) and overlaid text as if on real typewriter (ie xxxx for delete)
(maybe 2 or 3 layers of fonts so parts can be overlapped or uneven or whatever)
try to keep links, effects, transitions etc naturalistic or unusual (but above all unobtrusive)
SINGLE PAGE, SINGLE SCREEN (navigation will just make judicious use of append and remove)



ideas:
style stories put on site itself in line with overall visual theme
??maybe redo any little apps I put up there in same style too (ie make lights game fit in my site, make terrarium fit in my site, etc)ASS/Compass, fonts, etc<br>
