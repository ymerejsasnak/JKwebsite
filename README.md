starting the long slow process of creating my web site<br>

going to use this as an opportunity to practice as much as possible<br>

but especially practice stuff I haven't used much/at all: media queries, transitions, grid layout,


NOTES:  need to chop up paper jpgs and definitely make them SMALLER FILE SIZE!!!! but still good looking


 content:

-games/apps I make...other CS related stuff
-published stories, writing related
-music - link to bandcamp page at least
-writings (this is not a blog!)
    -about all of above, giftedness, philosophy, avoidant personality/depression/anxiety, etc.
     (1st post - technology is not _good_ ---but not nec bad either)

design:

go with mostly grayscale, paper background, typewriter fonts
!part of design is the way I type the text! (see example already in html) and overlaid text as if on real typewriter (ie xxxx for delete)
(maybe 2 or 3 layers of fonts so parts can be overlapped or uneven or whatever)
try to keep links, effects, transitions etc naturalistic or unusual (but above all unobtrusive)
SINGLE PAGE, SINGLE SCREEN (navigation will just make judicious use of append and remove)
LINKS - need to differentiate...maybe they pulse red or something?


ideas:
style stories put on site itself in line with overall visual theme

 eventually add js to make text (at least header) randomly weird!-gets more random more you click, make function for this that can be called as part of any action...start it off mostly normal...never 100% the same from beginning though...run this on other elements too? -->

 use a screen size or content div size black div and transform alpha value on click/link to fade to black then back to change content
