 [[idea: have little 'don't click here', if you do it runs my snow2 sliming thing over whole page (canvas overlaid)
    [[another idea: button that goes to alternate style (8bit msdos retro sort of look) but with exact same content (prob just load new html/css files)




[[[[REDESIGN!!!!!!!!]]]]





starting the long slow process of creating my web site<br>

going to use this as an opportunity to practice as much as possible<br>

but especially practice stuff I haven't used much/at all: media queries, transitions, grid layout,


TO DO: 
make all img as small as possible filesize-wise
start filling in content
-add seperate link to good example web pages I've made too? (for portfolio purposes)
-add link to my github on about, maybe other stuff just for fun like goodreads, etc.

??
 eventually add js to make text (at least main header) randomly weird!-gets more random more you click, make function for this that can be called as part of any action...start it off mostly normal...never 100% the same from beginning though...run this on other elements too? -->
