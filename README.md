starting the long slow process of creating my web site<br>

going to use this as an opportunity to practice as much as possible<br>

but especially practice stuff I haven't used much/at all: media queries, transitions, grid layout,


TO DO: 
get yellowed paper pieces again and chop up and make transparent
make all img as small as possible filesize-wise
make the JS stuff that will randomize the text


design:

!part of design is the way I type the text! (see example already in html) and overlaid text as if on real typewriter (ie xxxx for delete)
(maybe 2 or 3 layers of fonts so parts can be overlapped or uneven or whatever)
try to keep links, effects, transitions etc naturalistic or unusual (but above all unobtrusive)


ideas:

 eventually add js to make text (at least header) randomly weird!-gets more random more you click, make function for this that can be called as part of any action...start it off mostly normal...never 100% the same from beginning though...run this on other elements too? -->

  text that rotates? (when clicked or constantly or what?  just pieces of words or???)
